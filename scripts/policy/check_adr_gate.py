"""Policy: ADR files under ``docs/adr/`` are append-only.

ADRs are immutable once Accepted. An autonomous run may ADD a new ADR
file but must NOT modify any existing one - those edits require a human
approval gate per the layered audit pattern's overflow rule.

This check inspects the working-tree diff against HEAD:
  * NEW files under ``docs/adr/`` are allowed.
  * MODIFIED or DELETED files under ``docs/adr/`` block the run.

The check is deliberately strict. If a typo or metadata correction is
genuinely needed, the operator runs the change manually outside the
pipeline; the policy gate does not silently approve it.

If the project does not have a `docs/adr/` directory, this check is
vacuous (passes).
