# 5-lens self-audit (before every push)

This is the implementation-side counterpart to the verification-side audit protocol at `<AUDIT_PROTOCOL_PATH>`. The verification protocol governs how the auditing agent audits work that has already landed. This document governs how the implementing agent audits its own work *before* a push, so the verification turn finds less to fix.

Both <IMPLEMENTER_AGENT> and <AUDITOR_AGENT> read this file. The rule body, the artifact-state checklist, and the report format below are shared. The implementing-agent-side discipline (chat-promise rejection) and the verifier-side discipline (mandatory 10-section output) live in their respective files.

## The rule

**HARD RULE.** Before any `git push` that touches code, docs, or status artifacts, run a hostile 5-lens self-audit on the actual diff. The audit result is part of the report. No exceptions even when the change "feels small" or "is just a typo fix."

## Why this rule exists

The failure mode it prevents: an implementation commit lands, CI is green, the implementing agent declares "done," and then the auditor finds a list of real drift items the implementing agent should have caught - wrong endpoint paths, stale totals, contradictory sign-off blocks, overclaims, "zero skips" without qualification, "Closed" without cited evidence, and durable docs (README, CHANGELOG, HANDOFF, PR body, verification log) drifting in parallel because they're treated as artifacts to update sometimes rather than as state to maintain.

The drift isn't in features. It's in the surrounding durable artifacts that should move with every code commit but don't because the implementing agent treats them as artifacts instead of state.

## The five lenses

Each lens is *hostile* - assume the diff lies until evidence proves otherwise.

1. **Engineering.** Read the diff. For every claim, name, path, version, or API in the changes: grep the actual code/config to verify it matches reality. If the diff names `/api/staff/uploads`, grep the router. If it names a SHA or run ID, verify it against `gh run view`. If it names a file, verify the file exists. If it names a function or symbol, verify it's exported. Hostile means: assume the diff lies until grep proves otherwise.

2. **UX.** For any user-visible string, message, label, or workflow change: read it cold as if you'd never seen the feature. Does it make sense to a first-time operator? Does it match the copy in adjacent screens (terminology, voice, formality)? Does an error path have a "Next step" line? Does a success path actually surface to the user before the dialog unmounts? Hostile means: assume the user is confused until the copy proves it doesn't confuse them.

3. **Tests.** For any logic / data-flow / public-interface change: is there a test? Does it run? Does it lock the behavior, or does it merely *exercise* the code path? Does it actually execute in CI, or does it skip? Hostile means: a green check is not a real assertion; "passes" is not "covers." Skip predicates lie by default - verify they don't apply.

4. **Docs.** For every code change: did the README move with it? The CHANGELOG? The HANDOFF (if applicable)? The PR body? The verification log? The finding ledger if there is one? The ADRs if an architectural decision changed? Hostile means: a doc that's silent about a change you just made is wrong, not "OK because the code is right."

5. **QA.** Read the final state, not the diff. Open the changed files as the next agent walking in cold. Are there contradictions across files? Does the README say one thing while the ops doc says another? Does the ledger top-totals row reconcile with the row count? Are status words used per the audit protocol (`Closed` / `Implemented` / `Open` / `Deferred by Director` / `Blocked`, never `done` / `ready` / `taggable` / `shippable`)? Hostile means: assume drift until cross-file reading proves there is none.

## Artifact-state checklist

This is the specific drift that has bitten this project most. Run every item before push.

- [ ] Finding ledger top-totals row matches the actual row count by severity.
- [ ] Every `Closed` row cites: implementing SHA + verification (CI run ID or grep/pytest command) + docs touched.
- [ ] No row says `(this commit)` - replace with the actual SHA before pushing.
- [ ] PR body matches branch state: no stale `N of M` counts, no checkbox left unchecked for an item now Closed, no missing run IDs.
- [ ] CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` or version block matches what shipped - no "All exit criteria met" if there was a carve-out, no stale test counts.
- [ ] HANDOFF.md (or equivalent live state doc) names the current branch, current HEAD, current tag, current PR. Read it like a new agent walking in.
- [ ] Verification log on tag candidates: no "Ready to tag" claim without the tag-blocking gates Closed with proof.
- [ ] Status words: no `done`, `green`, `ready`, `taggable`, `shippable`, `complete` unless the release gate actually supports them.
- [ ] Working tree clean except intentional/declared uncommitted work (state it explicitly in the report).
- [ ] Cleanroom claims qualified: CI cleanroom skips are CI-only; local cleanroom skips are local-only; never collapse them.
- [ ] Whole-PR diff scope check: `git diff --name-status main..HEAD` must contain only the slice's intended file set. `git status --short` is not sufficient; sibling commits can land unrelated files.
- [ ] Non-ASCII scan on every new/modified durable doc: em-dashes, arrows, and section signs should be ASCII unless intentional. Run `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 grep -P '[^\x00-\x7F]' <files>` before push.

<!-- Project-specific items accumulate here. When the auditor surfaces a new drift pattern,
     add it as a checklist item AND add the longer entry in <PROJECT>_AUDIT_PROTOCOL.md
     section 22.

     Example:

- [ ] For every new SA model column with `server_default`, the default is a real SQL
      expression (`text("CURRENT_TIMESTAMP")` or equivalent), not a string literal.

## Post-push SHA-propagation step

Separate post-push pass, not optional. After `git push` succeeds:

1. Capture the new HEAD SHA (`git rev-parse HEAD`).
2. Wait for CI to complete on that SHA, then capture the new run IDs (`gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 8`).
3. Update PR body via `gh pr edit` so:
   - Every "Branch state on `<SHA>`" header names the new HEAD.
   - Every CI run ID link in the body matches `gh run list` for the new SHA. Old run IDs are stale and misleading even if they were green.
4. Update HANDOFF.md (or equivalent) so:
   - `Current HEAD:` line matches the new SHA.
   - Last-updated date is today.
   - CI run IDs cited match the new SHA.
   - Status sentence accurately describes what's blocking (don't carry forward yesterday's blocker sentence).
5. If the finding ledger cites SHAs/run IDs as proof of Closed status, *decide explicitly* whether to update them to the new SHA or leave them as historical proof anchors. Either is defensible. What is NOT defensible: mixing without an explanation. Cite the policy in the ledger preamble.
6. Re-run the verification grep from the audit protocol against the new state, not the pre-push state.

The previous push's report cannot honestly say "Artifact-state: pass" until this post-push pass completes.

## The proof-anchor vs release-target distinction

A tracked file cannot self-cite its own commit SHA: adding or amending the file changes the SHA. Verification logs, ledgers, and release notes must therefore distinguish:

- **Proof-anchor SHA** - the SHA whose tree contains the first green-CI-and-cleanroom evidence. Row-level proof citations pin here.
- **Release/tag target** - the final branch or merge commit after the director confirms release. Tags go here, not at the proof anchor.

The proof anchor and the tag SHA are distinct concepts. Collapsing them produces an infinite-regress loop because every amend-to-cite-the-new-SHA commit moves the SHA.

## Report format

Include in the user-facing report after the push:

```text
5-lens self-audit:
- Engineering: [pass | findings: ...]
- UX:          [pass | findings: ...]
- Tests:       [pass | findings: ...]
- Docs:        [pass | findings: ...]
- QA:          [pass | findings: ...]
Artifact-state: [pass | findings: ...]
Post-push propagation: [pass | findings: ...]
```

If any lens has findings, fix before push. If after a push an adversarial audit (cross-agent auditor, independent review, audit-team) still finds drift, that is direct evidence this rule isn't sticking; update or strengthen it.
